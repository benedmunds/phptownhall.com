            In this episode Ben and Phil discuss what’s new in their pathetic little lives, the state of the PHP-FIG, and bid an ecstatic.. ahem.. sad farewell to Phil as he departs the podcast.  Starting with Episode 51 Amanda Folson will be taking over as co-host.  Ben is staying so don’t worry, we know he’s your favorite.

            An all star cast this episode, as Ben and Phil are joined by regular guest Anthony Ferrara - thinker of good ideas and long-time part-time side-line contributor to the PHP-FIG, Woody Gilk - one-speed rider &amp; BDFL of Kohana, and
Beau Simensen - author of a bunch of stuff including StackPHP.

            The notes for this episode were lost when Phil spilt some really hipster orange juice over his
laptop and bricked the whole thing. We do remember that returning guest Chris Boden and Chris Pitt swing by to talk async in PHP.

            Another SunshinePHP, and another rotating panel of excellent guests talking about stuff like podcasting, making a bit of money on the side from projects like books and whatnot, and we get some folks on to cover the FIG Secretary positions, which will hopefully help the FIG solve their identity problems.

            Ben and Phil have a little catch-up to try and get things back on track after a little 2015 lag. Basically this episode is just Sober Phil having a massive vent about how daft some people are on the Internet.
