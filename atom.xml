    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This episode is brought to you from thunderstruck Dallas, as part of the awesome conference that is <a href="http://lonestarphp.com">Lone Star PHP</a>. We are joined once again by the dynamic duo <a href="https://twitter.com/jcarouth">Jeff Carouth</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/shrtwhitebldguy">Matt Frost</a> off of the <a href="http://looselycoupled.info/">Loosely Coupled</a> podcast!</p>

<p>We mostly make a bunch of bad jokes then drag up the audience to talk about stuff. Lets be honest, this was a bit of a crapshoot, but Elizabeth Smith goes into some detail on PECL and the problems of ownership. PSR-7 is chatted about for the 19th time and Jordi talks a bit about pickles.</p>

<p>Also, we debate “haytch” vs. “atch” as the correct pronunciation of the “H” in HTTP. Important stuff.</p>

<p>Audio only this time folks!</p>

<p>We thought it would be good to have a bit of a chat about the feature, the nonsense that surrounded it and a bunch of other random internals and PHP 7 related blathering. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We all know that SunshinePHP is one of the PHP communities finest conferences. It attends an amazing group of people, wonderful speakers and Rasmus usually pops in for a drive-by-keynote. </p>

<p>Every conference Phil or Ben attend has some vague promise of “yeah we’ll probably try and do a recording there or something,” but this SunshinePHP we actually did it, all thanks to the wonderful <a href="http://twitter.com/SammyK">Sammy K</a> off of <a href="https://www.phproundtable.com/">PHP Roundtable</a>. </p>

<p>The topic this time around was that of APIs, and we were joined by an <em>all star</em> panel: </p>

<p>Watch this. It’s hilarious.</p>

These two chaps were <a href="http://harikt.com/">Hari K T</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mwop">Matthew Weier O’Phinney</a>.</p>

<p>Now PSR chats can be a little boring when its about autoloading or tabs v bloody spaces, but this PSR could have some really big impact on the way you write PHP over the next few years.</p>

<p>We talk a bunch about Aura and Zend and their plans around middlewares, what motivated Matthew to get involved with taking over PSR-7, what middlewares mean for PHP in general and some of the concerns that have been fixed in recent iterations of the PSR like mutability, streams, etc.</p>

<p>There also a bit of chat about turtles, standing desks and broken ribs, while Phil slowly goes loopy on pain killers.</p>

After all, it doesn’t just need to be a one-way street.﻿</p>

<p>We also talk about a few general bits, like whether <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/php57">PHP 5.7 should have happened</a>, <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_php4_constructors">should we cry over spilled constructors</a> and Gary bangs on for ages about how Waterfall is better than Agile.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a big one. We’ve had Chris “The Grumpy Programmer” Hartjes and Ed “The Grumpy Podcaster” Finkler on our show before, but this time they both join us for a mashup!</p>

<p>We talk about the perils of being opinionated people speaking in public. Chris basically just says fuck Reddit and all of its minions of evil, and Phil gives a bit of insight into why he gets stuck in so many arguments.</p>

<p>We move on to chatting about PHP, and how people feel about a strong new demand for more async features. Is it better to leave that to other tools, or should we try and fit some into the language itself, and the ecosystem around it?</p>

<p>The last chunk of this podcast ends with a discussion around CodeIgniter 3.0 supporting PHP 5.2 and up. Should it be higher? Is it feckless to release like this? Should this be a documentation change to warn users away or a hard change to make it not even work there? </p>

<p>Also, who has the best beard? Hint: it isn’t Phil. </p>

<a href="https://twitter.com/_beakman">Bryan Crowe</a>.</p>

<p>Ben is AWOL, Phil is insanely jet-lagged and has no idea what he is talking about. Our awesome guests try their best to carry Phil through the show, where we discuss <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/markstory/2014/11/17/cakephp_3_0_0-beta3_released">exciting</a> new <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/jameswatts/2014/12/16/cakephp_3_to_fully_adopt_psr-2">stuff</a> happening with <a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a>, and what we think of a few current RFCs being discussed in PHP land.</p>

<p>We also talk a bit about <a href="https://github.com/thephpleague/monga">Monga</a>, a <a href="http://thephpleague.com">League</a> package which Bryan has now assumed the role of project lead. </p>

<p>It took a while to get this one out, but the next recording will be <a href="https://plus.google.com/b/114546315704097272137/events/cjaeesv1vt4bphb36pb33m4p2gc">December 28th</a> and it’s going to be a Christmas mash-up with <a href="http://devhell.info/post/2014-12-18/lets-get-this-thing-over-with/">/dev/hell</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week Ben and Phil are joined by long distance target shooter <a href="https://twitter.com/pmjones">Paul M. Jones</a> and the handsome man that is <a href="https://twitter.com/rdlowrey">Daniel Lowrey</a>, to talk about a whole bunch of PHP relating things.</p>

<p>Paul has recently been talking a lot about “Action Domain Responder” which is billed as a more representative 
replacement of the often mis-used “Model View Controller” architecture. Luckily he does a good job of ELI5 so we don’t get too lost, and we talk a bit about how <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/6020">ADR helps with putting content negotiation in a logical place</a>.</p>

<p>Daniel then goes on to talk about a few awesome topics, including some of the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/migration56.openssl.php">OpenSSL changes in 5.6</a>, and a HTTP server he is working on built entirely from PHP. It’s async, non-blocking <em>and</em> web-scale. </p>

<p>We cover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_2.0">HTTP 2</a> and its effect on PHP, give some thoughts on <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/http-message.md">PSR-7 HTTP Message</a>, talk about <a href="http://auraphp.com">Aura</a> and finally when Phil could hold it no more, we had a big rant about PHP 6 v PHP 7 which - at the time - was still being voted on. The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/php6">end result</a> is of course that PHP 7 won. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Ben and Phil join forces with <a href="http://looselycoupled.info/">Loosely Coupled</a> to talk about Open Source, burn out and briefly discuss their favorite open source projects. Jeff was out of action for a lot of it due to unexpected wifi troubles (in San Francisco of all places) so he sadly did not get to take part as much as he would have liked.</p>

<p>Questions this time around:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you deal nicely with someone who’s too reliant on you for solving problems and is too quick to ask you rather than figure it out themselves?
– TazeTSchnitzel</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you guys explain OSS to non tech people? My wife finds it strange that I do work for “free”
– Chuck Reeves</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a contractor, how do you feel about “OSS” clauses (that your work can/will be open sourced) in contracts?
– Davey Shafik</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you aren’t following Jeff and Matt then definitely go and do that:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This episode is a long one, but we are back to improved audio and the video is not just one dude eating pzza for an hour. <a href="http://twitter.com/codeguy">Josh Lockhart</a> of <a href="http://phptherightway.com">PHP The Right Way</a> and <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim</a> fame, and <a href="http://twitter.com/jmikola">Jeremy Mikola</a> who is well known for banging on about <a href="http://vimeo.com/89325708">clouds</a> and playing magic the gathering. Oh, he also works for MongoDB.</p>

<p><em><strong>Warning:</strong> Puns and occasional swears.</em></p>

<p>Some projects have been discovering they use language which can be offensive like master/slave. How do they deal with it, and how should they deal with it?</p>

<p>We ask Joshua what the plans for are for Slim 3, and talk a bit about the differences between Slim and Silex. We also ask him about the history of <a href="http://phptherightway.com">PHP The Right Way</a>: how it got started and how it has evolved over time with contributions and huge efforts from the PHP community.</p>

<p>Phil rants about <a href="https://github.com/illuminate/pagination">illuminate/pagination</a> having hard dependencies and tries to make excuses up for not sending a pull request, then comically days later caves and <a href="https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/4582">sends a pull request</a>.</p>

<p>The whole gang discuss difficulties of managing pull requests, covering how to handle the expectations of the pull “requester” and the pull “requestee”, how to handle feedback and a few other bits and bobs.</p>

<p>This is a fairly chunky episode but these guests were long overdue, and they’re such nice guys we had to chat and answer as many questions as we could. </p>

    <link href="http://phptownhall.com/blog/2014/06/18/episode-26-hello-front-range/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://frontrangephp.org/">Front Range</a> PHP user-group joins the show as a live audience for the episode 26, in a new crazy bonus format which Phil thought might be fun. The idea of the episode is for people to generally pick our brain about PHP and code and tech and things. It kinda worked but the sound quality was terrible. Sorry about that folks.</p>

<p>They ask us a bunch of questions about how we got started in PHP.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Picking a framework that would last 10 years for enterprise?</li>
  <li>How to migrate from CodeIgniter to Laravel?</li>
  <li>What do you use for integration tests?</li>
</ul>

<p>The video provides great insight into what you lot look like when you’re sat at a user group shoving pizza into your face, which we thought might be different for our viewers. That might also be a lie, and we accidentally left it on the wrong camera, but hey… there is a MP3 version too.</p>

    <link href="http://phptownhall.com/blog/2014/05/28/episode-25-girls-arent-any-different/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-28T15:39:38-04:00</updated>

    <link rel="enclosure" href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/phptownhall/25.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Talking about feminism in tech is always difficult. This episode was quite a heated discussion with <a href="https://twitter.com/kayladnls">Kayla Daniels</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/justjessdc">Jessica D’Amico</a> discussing their opinions about women-orientated groups such as <a href="http://phpwomen.org/">PHPWomen</a> and <a href="http://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a>.</p>

<p>Kayla wrote an excellent article titled <a href="https://medium.com/web-design-and-development/f3c8dbb03967">Not a shiny unicorn</a>, in which she made several points.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Somehow, [being female] means I am some kind of oddity. I’ve been met with skepticism, mistrust, and probably the most insulting reaction; complete shock and awe.”</li>
  <li>“If I’m offered something, I want it to be because of my accomplishments, and not my sex.”</li>
  <li>“Bottom line: Girls aren’t any different. We’re different because people keep making us different.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Essentially saying that specialist groups that try to help nurture female involvement can be seen - by some - to be a little patronising, like girls need special help, etc. Also whenever people freakout in the office because there is “a girl” there, things get weird. Suddenly swearing is completely frowned upon and people rush over to appologise to the nearest girl in earshot when it happens. These sorts of things have been noticed by Phil several times in his attending of conferences, workplace situations, etc, so it looked like an interesting topic to discuss. </p>

<p>Now, we could of just invited Kayla on to talk about it but an hour-long episode of people sitting around agreeing with each other does not really make for a representative conversation, or interesting listening. Friend of the show Jess joined us, and she had some different opinions about the situation.</p>

<p>Due to poor preperation on Phils side (he spent the two hours before the show cooking some epic dinner for his Dad after forgetting about the show) followed by some poor moderation Ben and Phil, the animated conversation was not the most productive that could have happened.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Since then, several productive things have happened. Kayla has released an amazing site called <a href="http://codemanifesto.com/">Code Manifesto</a> which addresses some of the points made.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a site Phil forgot to mention entirely was <a href="http://dayssincelasttechincident.com/">Days Since Last Tech Incident</a>, which is the answer to the question he asked: where can people find out more information about incidents so they can learn to keep an eye out for them, and attempt to help solve the problems or stop them happening again.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Ben and Phil both appologize for poor moderation leading to a tricky episode, and we appologize for how long it took us to get the episode up. A further appology for the lack of video, but we had to edit this one a bit and the video didn’t make it. </p>

<p>Episode 26 is already recorded and will be up in a few days, and Episode 27 is happening tonight, <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cusmuo47gr09fq0pqp4dlpr5ahc">live on Google Plus</a> as always.</p>

<p>Most of this conversation centers around Phil and Ben’s horrible facial hair with a few questions thrown Steve’s way to educate us on getting the most out of your LAMP stack.  The main takeaways are to stop using Apache and to start using Postgres.</p>

Phil was too busy having a real world life to join us this week, boo!</p>

<p>Don does a great job of articulating why switching the Joomla! Framework to an LGPL license would be best for everyone and just might cure cancer.  Ben tries to play devil’s advocate but eventually can’t even maintain the ruse.  David talks now and then, mostly about his new found love of the AeroPress.</p>
