        <title>Episode 78: Into The Woodchipper</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Matt and Ben are joined by Chris Fidao (who watched with horror as Matt butchered his last name). The conversation takes a deep dive into how Chris and Dave Hemphill built ChipperCI include the why, the how and what were some of the fun challenges to building a CI service. We talked briefly about how Chris found good use cases for Golang, but Chris still loves PHP.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Episode 77: Lets be Frank</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Matt and Ben are joined by the League of Extraordinary Packages chief benevolent dictator for life Frank De Jonge (@frankdejonge. Its pronounced “de-yong”, not like how Matt pronounced it. He is sorry). We talk about Frank’s contributions to the League, and how it makes him feel to have a package download count in the 8 digits. Frank also talks about his work on Eventsauce (eventsauce.io) an event driven framework that integrates well into most PHP projects.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Episode 76: Mad Max DevRel</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Twilio crew, bored because they can’t go to conferences to show people the cool shit you can build with their APIs, take over the podcast to talk about life as a grounded devrel. Matt is joined by Margaret Staples (@dead_lugosi), Gary Hockin (@geeh) and back to back guest Marcus Battle (@themarcusbattle). We discuss the Twilio Quest project and how Twilio is leveraging new ways for their dev rels to get their brand out there. We also talk about what we miss most about not being able to go to conferences and drink with friends. It got a little dark there. Sorry. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/matthewtrask&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benedmunds&quot;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; are joined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/themarcusbattle&quot;&gt;Marcus Battle&lt;/a&gt; to talk about his career path from being a data nerd at WebDev Studios to being a content creator and curator at Twilio. We talk about how much work is involved being a total grammar junky, and does Marcus get early access to things like the supposed Twilio Pigeon API. We also talk about the coveted Twilio swag from back in the days where we were allowed to go to conferences. Then we nerd out about music for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
