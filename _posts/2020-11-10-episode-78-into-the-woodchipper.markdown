Matt and Ben are joined by Chris Fidao (who watched with horror as Matt butchered his last name). The conversation takes a deep dive into how Chris and Dave Hemphill built ChipperCI include the why, the how and what were some of the fun challenges to building a CI service. We talked briefly about how Chris found good use cases for Golang, but Chris still loves PHP.
