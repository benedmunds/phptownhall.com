Two awesome guests join this week, from two different framework projects, both who have been very vocal about their interest in [PSR-7: HTTP Message]. These two chaps were [Hari K T](http://harikt.com/) and [Matthew Weier O'Phinney](https://twitter.com/mwop).

Now PSR chats can be a little boring when its about autoloading or tabs v bloody spaces, but this PSR could have some really big impact on the way you write PHP over the next few years.

We talk a bunch about Aura and Zend and their plans around middlewares, what motivated Matthew to get involved with taking over PSR-7, what middlewares mean for PHP in general and some of the concerns that have been fixed in recent iterations of the PSR like mutability, streams, etc.

There also a bit of chat about turtles, standing desks and broken ribs, while Phil slowly goes loopy on pain killers.
