[Matt Trask](https://twitter.com/matthewtrask) and [Ben Edmunds](https://twitter.com/benedmunds) are joined by [Jordi Bggiano](https://twitter.com/seldaek) and [Mils Adermann](https://twitter.com/naderman) to celebrate Composer finally figuring out how to self invoke its own `composer self-upgrade` command. We discuss the origins of the project, how they deal with the fame they have found, how they run their business and OSS project and how people who like the project can help give back!
