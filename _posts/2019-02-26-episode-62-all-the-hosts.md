[Matt Trask](https://twitter.com/matthewtrask), [Ben Edmunds](https://twitter.com/benedmunds), and [Amanda Folson](https://twitter.com/AmbassadorAwsum) are joined by our deported former co-host [Phil Sturgeon](https://twitter.com/PhilSturgeon).  

There's not much of an agenda to this episode.  We all catch up on what's new with Phil and we fill him in on what's new with PHP.
