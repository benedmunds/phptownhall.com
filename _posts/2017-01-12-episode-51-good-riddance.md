In this episode Ben and Phil discuss what's new in their pathetic little lives, the state of the PHP-FIG, and bid an ecstatic.. ahem.. sad farewell to Phil as he departs the podcast.  Starting with Episode 51 [Amanda Folson](https://twitter.com/AmbassadorAwsum) will be taking over as co-host.  Ben is staying so don't worry, we know he's your favorite.


Phil,
Thanks for 51 fucking fantastic episodes, 5 years of podcasting together, way too much booze, and a lot of fun.
