The notes for this episode were lost when Phil spilt some really hipster orange juice over his
laptop and bricked the whole thing. We do remember that returning guest [Chris Boden](https://twitter.com/boden_c) and [Chris Pitt](https://twitter.com/assertchris) swing by to talk async in PHP.

In a future episode we'll probably talk about data backup strategies.

- [Benchmarking Codswallop: NodeJS vs PHP](https://philsturgeon.uk/php/2013/11/12/benchmarking-codswallop-nodejs-v-php/) - An oldie but a goody, why NodeJS isn't magically better at async than PHP
- [Ratchet](http://socketo.me/) - WebSockets for PHP
- [A Case for Async PHP](https://medium.com/async-php/a-case-for-async-php-f33e5e31ebba) - Chris Pitt wrote about this stuff on Medium
- [icicle.io](https://icicle.io/) - Write asynchronous code using synchronous coding techniques in PHP
