Well known PHP/Laravel nice-guy [Jeffrey Way] from [NetTuts] and [Laracasts] joins regular guest [Zack Kitzmiller] to
discuss the wonderful world of Laravel once again. This time the discussion focuses on some of the silly complaints
people have with an otherwise wonderful system, and on the reusability of its packages.

* [Laracasts] - "Hi, I'm Jeffrey. What would you like to learn today?"
* [Modernizing Legacy Applications In PHP](https://leanpub.com/mlaphp) - Get your PHP code under control in a series of small, specific steps
* [DBAD (Dont Be a Dick) Public License](http://dbad-license.org) - Something between [WTFPL] and [MIT]
* [Illuminate] - The components that make up the Laravel PHP framework
* [Laravel: Envoy](https://github.com/laravel/envoy) - Elegant SSH tasks for PHP
