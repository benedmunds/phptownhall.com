This episode is a long one, but we are back to improved audio and the video is not just one dude eating pzza for an hour. [Josh Lockhart] of [PHP The Right Way] and [Slim] fame, and [Jeremy Mikola] who is well known for banging on about [clouds] and playing magic the gathering. Oh, he also works for MongoDB.

_**Warning:** Puns and occasional swears._

Some projects have been discovering they use language which can be offensive like master/slave. How do they deal with it, and how should they deal with it?

We ask Joshua what the plans for are for Slim 3, and talk a bit about the differences between Slim and Silex. We also ask him about the history of [PHP The Right Way]: how it got started and how it has evolved over time with contributions and huge efforts from the PHP community.

Phil rants about [illuminate/pagination] having hard dependencies and tries to make excuses up for not sending a pull request, then comically days later caves and [sends a pull request].

The whole gang discuss difficulties of managing pull requests, covering how to handle the expectations of the pull "requester" and the pull "requestee", how to handle feedback and a few other bits and bobs.

This is a fairly chunky episode but these guests were long overdue, and they're such nice guys we had to chat and answer as many questions as we could.
