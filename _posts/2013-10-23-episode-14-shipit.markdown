This episode Ben and Phil are joined by [Lee Tengum](http://thatleeguy.com/), who has sold more apps
than Phil and Ben have even thought of. He founded [Pancake Payments](https://pancakeapp.com/) which has
been featured in Inc. Magazine and is doing very well in the very crowded sector of invoice, time-tracking
and basic project management. Lee also works as a freelance developer for local companies in the "city"
of Cranbrook, BC, Canadia.

We got Lee on to share some of his success stories of building small, simple, useful products that do not
try to be the next Facebook but make good money and help him keep his family in food, maple syrup and hockey
gear. Making one application that sells for a bazillion dollars is fairly unlikely, so Lee tries to build
"mortgage payments" instead, shipping early, iterating fast, bootstrapping the process and focusing on revenue
from a very early point.
