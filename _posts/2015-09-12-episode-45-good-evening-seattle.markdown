Live from [PNWPHP '15](http://pnwphp.com/), Ben and Phil are joined by guests [Ben Marks](https://twitter.com/benmarks), [Yitzchok Willroth](https://twitter.com/coderabbi) and later we are joined by returning guest [Sara Golemon](https://twitter.com/SaraMG) who popped in to talk about HHVM/Hack while Phil played waiter for the rest of the episode.

Ben talks about Magento and some of his conference traveling madness, as does Yitz, who got trapped in a hotel for a whole weekend due to some interesting combination of Jewish holidays and an argument over the interational date line in New Zealand. Phil also tells us all about his NZ speeding ticket, mowing down possums like it's Carmageddon, and makes a few terrible jokes because [he's scarily sober](https://philsturgeon.uk/charity/2015/08/22/no-booze/).
