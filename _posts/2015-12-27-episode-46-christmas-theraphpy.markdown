Ben and Phil have a little catch-up to try and get things back on track after a little 2015 lag. Basically this episode is just Sober Phil having a massive vent about daft people are on the Internet.

For some reason he accidentally read some /r/lolphp and got into an argument about how they think that PHP 7 is purely a cosmetic change. This was a good excuse to re-emphisize what an awesome set of fundamental changes PHP 7 really was.

Ben and Phil then discuss the FIGs identity crisis before Phil goes off on another ramble about that. We'll cover that better on later episodes!
