[Matt](https://twitter.com/matthewtrask) and [Ben](https://twitter.com/benedmunds) are joined by [Marcus Battle](https://twitter.com/themarcusbattle) to talk about his career path from being a data nerd at WebDev Studios to being a content creator and curator at Twilio. We talk about how much work is involved being a total grammar junky, and does Marcus get early access to things like the supposed Twilio Pigeon API. We also talk about the coveted Twilio swag from back in the days where we were allowed to go to conferences. Then we nerd out about music for a minute.
