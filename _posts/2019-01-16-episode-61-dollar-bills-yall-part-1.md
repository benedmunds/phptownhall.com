[Matt Trask](https://twitter.com/matthewtrask) and [Ben Edmunds](https://twitter.com/benedmunds) are joined by [Jason McCreary](https://twitter.com/gonedark) and [Anthony Fox](https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/__wtfox__) to discuss budgeting and personal finance for developers.  

This episode takes a high level view and focuses on how new developers can make good decisions and avoid common pitfalls that come along with that first "developer money" paycheck.

We'll be back for part 2 shortly.
