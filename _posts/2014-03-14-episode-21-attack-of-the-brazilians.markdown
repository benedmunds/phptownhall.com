This week author of "[Vagrant CookBook]" [Érika Heidi] and serial usergroup creator [Rafael Dohms] join the show to
talk about... well, all of that. Two Brazilian PHP developers now living in Amsterdam, tell their stories and talk
about what they do.

We cover a lot of conversation connected to Vagrant and some of its upcoming features and functionality. We also talk
about provisioning, comparing Chef, Puppet and Ansible.

This weeks questions from the audience:

> What are your thoughts on using Bash as a provisioner? Why or why not use it?
-- Edmund Zynda

> Thoughts on the new github Atom editor
-- Matthew Reschke
