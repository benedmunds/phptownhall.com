[Matt Trask](https://twitter.com/matthewtrask) and [Amanda Folson](https://twitter.com/AmbassadorAwsum/) are joined by [Ryan Weaver](https://twitter.com/weaverryan) to take a look at the landscape of the Symfony Ecosystem.

They discuss a few new packages from the Symfony team such as Mailer, HTTP Interface, API Platform as well as discussing the EU's funding of a 48 hour hackathon that Ryan woke up at 3am in the morning for.
