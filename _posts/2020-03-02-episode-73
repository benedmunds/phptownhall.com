[Matt Trask](https://twitter.com/matthewtrask) and [Ben Edmunds](https://twitter.com/benedmunds) are joined by [Woody Gilk](https://twitter.com/shadowhand). We talk about what its like to 
birth a framework, and then mercilessly kill it. We also talk about how Woody got involved with the [League of Extraordinary Packages](https://twitter.com/thephpleague) and how someone can get involved with the [PHP FIG](https://twitter.com/phpfig).
