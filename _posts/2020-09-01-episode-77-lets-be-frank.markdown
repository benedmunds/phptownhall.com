Matt and Ben are joined by the League of Extraordinary Packages chief benevolent dictator for life Frank De Jonge (@frankdejonge. Its pronounced "de-yong", not like how Matt pronounced it. He is sorry). We talk about Frank's contributions to the League, and how it makes him feel to have a package download count in the 8 digits. Frank also talks about his work on Eventsauce (eventsauce.io) an event driven framework that integrates well into most PHP projects.
