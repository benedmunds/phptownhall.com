Regular guest [Anthony Ferrara](https://twitter.com/ircmaxell) joins us "in the studio" to talk about the new version of his [scalar type hints], which since recording - a f**king month ago - has been accepted for PHP 7.

We thought it would be good to have a bit of a chat about the feature, the nonsense that surrounded it and a bunch of other random internals and PHP 7 related blathering.
