This week [Ben Edmunds](http://benedmunds.com) and [Phil Sturgeon](http://philsturgeon.co.uk) are joined by [Jacques Woodcock](https://twitter.com/jacques_thekit) and [Jordan Kasper](https://twitter.com/jakerella) to discuss [virtPHP](http://virtphp.org/).

virtPHP is a tool for managing multiple environments on your development machine.  It is similar to Python's virtualenv or Ruby's rbenv, but for PHP.

<br />

###Upcoming Conferences
Phil will be speaking at [PHP South Africa](http://www.phpsouthafrica.com/) in April.

Ben has no idea what he will attend this year.

Jacques will likely be speaking at [True North PHP](http://truenorthphp.ca/) later this year.

Jordan will be speaking at [jQuery UK](http://jqueryuk.com/) in May and at [Dutch PHP](http://www.phpconference.nl/) in June.
