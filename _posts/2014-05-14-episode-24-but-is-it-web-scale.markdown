This week [Ben Edmunds](http://benedmunds.com) calls in from Portland and [Phil Sturgeon](http://philsturgeon.co.uk) calls in from THE FUTURE.  They are joined by [Steve Corona](http://stevecorona.com/) to discuss [Scaling PHP](https://www.scalingphpbook.com/).

Most of this conversation centers around Phil and Ben's horrible facial hair with a few questions thrown Steve's way to educate us on getting the most out of your LAMP stack.  The main takeaways are to stop using Apache and to start using Postgres.

Go buy Steve's book [Scaling PHP](https://www.scalingphpbook.com/) if you want to be Web Scale.
