1. Accidentally for and against

Pro-sure they're a good idea i guess
Pro-everyone needs a coc and anyone against it is a bigot fuck
Pro-but dont wanna talk about it
Pro-think they're a stupid neccessity

Anti-they're unneccessary this doesnt happen
Anti-we're already doing this
Anti-the SJWs will steal our freedom of speech

2. Contributor Covenant
Myriads of conflation:

- It somehow affects you on Twitter, where as the RFC specifically says thats not true
- "her politics"
- "Enforcing the Contributor Covenant" guidelines on the community
  - no more relevant to the running of the mediation than "npm install covgen"

3. "Opalgate" https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/941

4. Anti-harrasment policy

5. Not talking about your whole life

6. Adam Culp at sunshine
that stuff happens, people dont know

7. minor comments vs ass grab

8. Shouting at victims

9. "People say Anthony was not listening or responding to feedback"
i.e he said he was not listening on the thread and said specifically he'd ignore it.

10. "diversity is a false goal"
