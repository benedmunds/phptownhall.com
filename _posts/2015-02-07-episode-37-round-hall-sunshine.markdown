We all know that SunshinePHP is one of the PHP communities finest conferences. It attends an amazing group of people, wonderful speakers and Rasmus usually pops in for a drive-by-keynote.

Every conference Phil or Ben attend has some vague promise of "yeah we'll probably try and do a recording there or something," but this SunshinePHP we actually did it, all thanks to the wonderful [Sammy K](http://twitter.com/SammyK ) off of [PHP Roundtable](https://www.phproundtable.com/).

The topic this time around was that of APIs, and we were joined by an _all star_ panel:

* [Josh Lockart](https://twitter.com/codeguy)
* [Eryn O'Neil](https://twitter.com/eryno)
* [Matthew Weier O'Phinney](https://twitter.com/mwop)
* [Davey Shafik](https://twitter.com/dshafik)
* [Mike Stowe](https://twitter.com/mikegstowe)

Watch this. It's hilarious.

Shownotes are lacking, because we clearly weren't writing anything down.
