The Twilio crew, bored because they can't go to conferences to show people the cool shit you can build with their APIs, take over the podcast to talk about life as a grounded devrel. Matt is joined by Margaret Staples (@dead_lugosi), Gary Hockin (@geeh) and back to back guest Marcus Battle (@themarcusbattle). We discuss the Twilio Quest project and how Twilio is leveraging new ways for their dev rels to get their brand out there. We also talk about what we miss most about not being able to go to conferences and drink with friends. It got a little dark there. Sorry. Enjoy!
