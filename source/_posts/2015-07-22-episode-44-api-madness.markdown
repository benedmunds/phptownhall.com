Listen to API pros [Amanda Folson](https://twitter.com/AmbassadorAwsum) and [Mike Stowe](https://twitter.com/mikegstowe) talk about API versioning, RAML, and all sorts of interesting API stuff.

Phil ended up having a listen to this after the fact, and found it awesome! This episode is probably better for him not being there, as there are some opinions that didn't initially match his, but they're really interesting and make him reconsider a few things.
