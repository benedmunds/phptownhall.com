Some episodes of this show are brought to you after more beers than others. This is one of those episodes where its more, so if you don't like swearing and listening to a slightly confused Bristolian ramble about points he occasionally forgets then you might want to skip this one.

Regardless Ben, Zack K. and Phil discuss the difference between PHP's organisational structure and lack of BDFL with that of Rails, or Linux. We then discuss service-orientated architecture a little and move onto how you should not box yourself into a single programming language - on your CV or in general as a programmer.
