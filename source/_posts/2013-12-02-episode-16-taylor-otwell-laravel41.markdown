Taylor Otwell comes back on the show for a second time and regular guest Zack Kitzmiller turns up to coerce Taylor 
into letting him speak at LaraCon 2014. 

Taylor was the first guest we ever had on PHP Town Hall talking about his plans for Laravel 4 before it was even released, so it gives us a great opportunity to look back on the year and see how things have gone. We discuss the changes to Laravel and it's community, and discuss how various changes in the PHP ecosystem (like PHP 5.3 support becoming less of a demand) could effect Laravel 4.1.

We also argue about Go and fight about Vagrant and Chef for a bit.
