PHP-FIG member Paul M. Jones and PHP contributor Anthony Ferrera come on the podcast with Ben, Phil and regular guest Zack Kitzmiller to discuss the new Package Orientated Autoloader Proposal (a.k.a PSR-X), and wether or not PSR's should ever be amended.

Paul explains why the new PSR-X is a handy idea for those who are already PSR-0 users, or even those that aren't, Zack flips a shit and gets bored of talking about standards wishing everyone could just use Python and their awesome PEP-8, we convince Paul to try swearing for once and we all try badgering Anthony into agreeing with us for some reason.

Nobody wins, but the argument brings up a lot of interesting topics and points of view, and that is mostly what we are here for.
