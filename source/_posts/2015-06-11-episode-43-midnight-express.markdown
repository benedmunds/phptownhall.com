Your two favourite PHP developers are joined this episode by [Emir Karşıyakalı](https://twitter.com/EmirKarsiyakali) off of [PHPKonf and IstanbulPHP](http://phpkonf.org/).

Istanbul is not only a beautiful and awesome city, but it's got a thriving PHP community too, who are currently hosting a whole bunch of PHP stars for their annual conference. 

Once again we promised to get this up before the conference to advertise it, and we're releasing this audio version the night before, but what can we say... we're shit at this.

You can find more announcements, episodes and random stuff on [iTunes Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/php-town-hall/id585240066?mt=2), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phptownhall), [Google](https://plus.google.com/b/114546315704097272137/+Phptownhall), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCepVwe7RrxE7Zv3kytUfcKw) and... you get the idea.
