This episode we're joined by two two top CakePHPers [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez](https://twitter.com/savant) and 
[Bryan Crowe](https://twitter.com/_beakman).

Ben is AWOL, Phil is insanely jet-lagged and has no idea what he is talking about. Our awesome guests try their best to carry Phil through the show, where we discuss [exciting](http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/markstory/2014/11/17/cakephp_3_0_0-beta3_released) new [stuff](http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/jameswatts/2014/12/16/cakephp_3_to_fully_adopt_psr-2) happening with [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/), and what we think of a few current RFCs being discussed in PHP land.

We also talk a bit about [Monga](https://github.com/thephpleague/monga), a [League](http://thephpleague.com) package which Bryan has now assumed the role of project lead. 

It took a while to get this one out, but the next recording will be [December 28th](https://plus.google.com/b/114546315704097272137/events/cjaeesv1vt4bphb36pb33m4p2gc) and it's going to be a Christmas mash-up with [/dev/hell](http://devhell.info/post/2014-12-18/lets-get-this-thing-over-with/).

Now that Phil has stopped being homeless we're going to get more regular, and drastically improve the quality of this podcast. Do not miss out!
