The grass is always greener on the other side, but we have a little talk with [Gary Hockin] and regular guest [Jacques Woodcock] about the pros and cons of going up and down the chain of command in the developer world. After all, it doesn't just need to be a one-way street.ï»¿

We also talk about a few general bits, like whether [PHP 5.7 should have happened](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/php57), [should we cry over spilled constructors](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_php4_constructors) and Gary bangs on for ages about how Waterfall is better than Agile.
