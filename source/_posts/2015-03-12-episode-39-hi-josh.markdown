For ages Phil and Ben have wanted to get [Josh Lockhart](https://twitter.com/codeguy) on the show, and for some reason it took until Episode 39 to happen.

Josh is involved in some great projects and interested in some new tools, which all kinda wind in together. PHP, FIG, League, etc.

* [Josh joined the FIG](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/php-fig/E3H6sUjonCk)
* [PSR-7](https://mwop.net/blog/2015-01-08-on-http-middleware-and-psr-7.html) which is gonna be used in Slim 3
* [New Stuff in Slim PHP 3.0](http://www.slimframework.com/2015/02/11/whats-up-with-version-3.html)
* [The new league/uploads project](https://github.com/thephpleague/uploads) - more info [on the League mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/thephpleague/uploads/thephpleague/pW4oapw9u-U/Ivv2EqGYLe4J)

We touch on a few topics, and really this one is just a fun fluid chat with a really relaxed guest.
