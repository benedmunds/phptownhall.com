The wonderfully handsome [Don Gilbert](http://twitter.com/dilbert4life) joins us on our new [YouTube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCepVwe7RrxE7Zv3kytUfcKw) for our first live-recording of PHP Town Hall! 

He's been working on the [Joomla Framework](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-framework) to get it up to scratch with modern standards ready for a [Joomla CMS](http://joomla.org) rewrite, much in the same way that EllisLab pulled CodeIgniter out of ExpressionEngine... except for the standards bit, because they didn't exist and PHP developers were too busy clubbing each other to death over tabs v spaces.

We discuss how that whole situation is going, how they've been implementing various standards, how did they decide to build a framework instead of use an existing one, how the [FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/) is going and why Phil fucked up the [PSR-4 Acceptance Vote](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/php-fig/acceptance$20vote/php-fig/NWfyAeF7Psk/_xk2QQuCYsIJ) three hours before the vote finished.

You might notice that video was recorded a while ago. Normally it won't take us two weeks to get the audio out, but the video's will always be out on the channel first. You should subscribe to [the channel](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCepVwe7RrxE7Zv3kytUfcKw?feature=watch) and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phptownhall) for announcements about when new live shows will be recorded. 

The next will be done November 18th, 2013 at 9:30pm EST.
