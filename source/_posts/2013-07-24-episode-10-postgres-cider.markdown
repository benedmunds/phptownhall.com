This time around we're joined by [Selena Deckelmann][selena], who as a Postgres contributor 
talks to us about some of the burning questions many PHP developers often have about Postgres 
when considering it as a replacement for the PHP's defacto-standard relational DB: MySQL.

We ask "Why are so few of the "cool kids" using Postgresql?" and "What are the most important differences between MySQL & Postgres?", and after a bunch of useful discussion on things like true full text search, 
complex indexes, PostGIS and Foreign Data Wrappers we end up discussing cider and chickens. Standard.
