[Alex Bilbie][alex] and [Zackary Blank][zach] come on the show to talk about OAuth 2, which has been getting a lot of 
flamey bad press over the last year or two after the original author quit the project.

Why these guys? Well, Alex until recently was working at the University of Lincoln where they did a 
whole bunch of OAuth 2 work as auth for various API projects at the university. During this time he 
created the fully spec compliant [CodeIgniter OAuth 2.0 Server][cioauth2server], which was later replaced 
with a new [generic PHP version][oauth2loep] for "The League of Extraordinary Packages". It's safe 
to say that Alex knows his shit when it comes to OAuth.

Zachary works for a different company on the same floor as Phil, and a client who shall remain 
nameless has been complaining about OAuth 2, for reasons that we both felt to be... well... 
silly. He's been using Alex's later library for several high-profile projects and is interested 
in the security angle.
