[Chris Boden](https://twitter.com/boden_c) joins us to talk about a [Ratchet](http://socketo.me/) and [React](http://reactphp.org/). The conversation is basically Ben and Phil asking a bunch of questions about how Ratchet works, pretending we know what is going on while Chris uses lots of words like "concurrency" and "non-blocking".

We decide that PHP is web-scale, event-driven programming is not just for NodeJS hipsters, we all take the "Are You a Brogrammer" test and [Michael Wales](https://twitter.com/walesmd) crashes the show half way through like a ninja.
