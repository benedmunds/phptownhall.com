[Joe Watkins](https://twitter.com/krakjoe) and [Sara Goleman](https://twitter.com/saramg) join Phil to make one hell of an episode. These two are not only core contributors to PHP, but are behind a lot of RFCs and decisions that make PHP considerably better. We talk about a whole bunch of awesome stuff, including progress of the [named parameters][] RFC - and the chances of it making in, the new accepted PHP 5.6 feature [PHPDBG][] and what it means for you, [HHVM][] and its relationship to "The PHP", wether PHP should have a spec for implementations of the language, and a whole bunch of other stuff. 

Sara knows a thing or two about HHVM because she helped build it.

Joe knows a thing or two about PHPDBG because he helped build it. 

So basically... THEY'RE SMARTER THAN YOU ARE SO LISTEN TO THEM DAMMIT!
