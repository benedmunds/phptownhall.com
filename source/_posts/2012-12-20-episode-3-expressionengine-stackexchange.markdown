ExpressionEngine Pro [Anna Brown][anna] and Testing Hero [Chris Hartjes][chris] join [Ben Edmunds][ben] and [Phil Sturgeon][phil] to discuss the recent rumblings in the ExpressionEngine community and the 
new [EE StackExchange site][stack]. We talk about Inversion of Control (IoC), what it is, why its useful and how it's done. 

We also talk a little bit about how PHP has been (and is continuing) to move towards a post-framework world thanks to independant framework-agnostic components - and of course we talk with Chris about unit-testing.
