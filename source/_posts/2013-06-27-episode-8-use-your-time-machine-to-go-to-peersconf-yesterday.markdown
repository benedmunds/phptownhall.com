In this episode Ben and Phil talk to the super-talented conference organiser [Jessica D'Amico][jess], joined 
by avoid conference goer and PHP rockstar Matt Frost. We all gab a bunch about conferences in general, 
specifically LaraCon, PeersConf and php|tek.

We fucked up and didn't get this episode out soon enough to actually get her any sales for her 
latest conferences [PeersConf][peers] (Phil is at PeersConf right now), but you should definitely 
follow Jess to see what conferences she puts on in the future, they're always great.
