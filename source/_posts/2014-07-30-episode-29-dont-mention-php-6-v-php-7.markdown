This week Ben and Phil are joined by long distance target shooter [Paul M. Jones] and the handsome man that is [Daniel Lowrey], to talk about a whole bunch of PHP relating things.

Paul has recently been talking a lot about "Action Domain Responder" which is billed as a more representative 
representation of the often mis-used "Model View Controller" architecture. Luckily he does a good job of ELI5 so we don't get too lost, and we talk a bit about how [ADR helps with putting content negotiation in a logical place].

Daniel then goes on to talk about a few awesome topics, including some of the [OpenSSL changes in 5.6], and a HTTP server he is working on built entirely from PHP. It's async, non-blocking _and_ web-scale. 

We cover [HTTP 2] and its effect on PHP, give some thoughts on [PSR-7 HTTP Message](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/http-message.md), talk about [Aura] and finally when Phil could hold it no more, we had a big rant about PHP 6 v PHP 7 which - at the time - was still being voted on. The [end result](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/php6) is of course that PHP 7 won.
