Cal Evans talks with us about some of the great projects he is (and has) been involved with, including training days, writing books, speaking, organising conferences and a bunch more.

Seriously, this guy has done a shitload of stuff:

Annoyingly in this episode Google Hangouts decided to keep the focus aimed squarely on Phil for the entire show, instead of following the sound of whoever is talking. Nobody needs that much of Phil's face so we're skipping the video in this post. It's mostly just Phil wandering around, drinking two different drinks at the same time, probably picking his nose a bit, who knows.
