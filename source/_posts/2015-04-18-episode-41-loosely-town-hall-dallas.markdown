This episode is brought to you from thunderstruck Dallas, as part of the awesome conference that is [Lone Star PHP](http://lonestarphp.com). We are joined once again by the dynamic duo [Jeff Carouth](https://twitter.com/jcarouth) and [Matt Frost](https://twitter.com/shrtwhitebldguy) off of the [Loosely Coupled] podcast!

We mostly make a bunch of bad jokes then drag up the audience to talk about stuff. Lets be honest, this was a bit of a crapshoot, but Elizabeth Smith goes into some detail on PECL and the problems of ownership. PSR-7 is chatted about for the 19th time and Jordi talks a bit about pickles.

Also, we debate "haytch" vs. "atch" as the correct pronunciation of the "H" in HTTP. Important stuff.

Audio only this time folks!
