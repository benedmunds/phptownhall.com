            This episode Ben and Phil are joined by Lee Tengum, who has sold more apps
than Phil and Ben have even thought of. He founded Pancake Payments which has
been featured in Inc. Magazine and is doing very well in the very crowded sector of invoice, time-tracking
and basic project management. Lee also works as a freelance developer for local companies in the “city”
of Cranbrook, BC, Canadia.

            Some episodes of this show are brought to you after more beers than others. This is one of those episodes where its more, so if you don’t like swearing and listening to a slightly confused Bristolian ramble about points he occasionally forgets then you might want to skip this one.

            This time around we’re joined by Selena Deckelmann, who as a Postgres contributor
talks to us about some of the burning questions many PHP developers often have about Postgres
when considering it as a replacement for the PHP’s defacto-standard relational DB: MySQL.

            Chris Boden joins us to talk about a Ratchet and React. The conversation is basically Ben and Phil asking a bunch of questions about how Ratchet works, pretending we know what is going on while Chris uses lots of words like “concurrency” and “non-blocking”.
