            With the vote for Strict Types in the balance, we have a chat with two core contributors about why they are for or against this RFC. On one side, Andrea Faulds, who wrote the RFC. On the other, Levi Morrison, who is responsible for one of PHP 7’s greatest features yet: return type hints.

            The grass is always greener on the other side, but we have a little talk with Gary Hockin and regular guest Jacques Woodcock about the pros and cons of going up and down the chain of command in the developer world. After all, it doesn’t just need to be a one-way street.﻿
