        <p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/krakjoe">Joe Watkins</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/saramg">Sara Goleman</a> join Phil to make one hell of an episode. These two are not only core contributors to PHP, but are behind a lot of RFCs and decisions that make PHP considerably better. We talk about a whole bunch of awesome stuff, including progress of the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/namedparameters">named parameters</a> RFC - and the chances of it making in, the new accepted PHP 5.6 feature <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/phpdbg">PHPDBG</a> and what it means for you, <a href="http://www.hhvm.com/">HHVM</a> and its relationship to “The PHP”, wether PHP should have a spec for implementations of the language, and a whole bunch of other stuff.</p>

than Phil and Ben have even thought of. He founded <a href="https://pancakeapp.com/">Pancake Payments</a> which has
been featured in Inc. Magazine and is doing very well in the very crowded sector of invoice, time-tracking
and basic project management. Lee also works as a freelance developer for local companies in the “city”
of Cranbrook, BC, Canadia.</p>
