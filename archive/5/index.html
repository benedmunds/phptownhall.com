            Regular guest Anthony Ferrara joins us “in the studio” to talk about the new version of his scalar type hints, which since recording - a f**king month ago - has been accepted for PHP 7.

            With the vote for Strict Types in the balance, we have a chat with two core contributors about why they are for or against this RFC. On one side, Andrea Faulds, who wrote the RFC. On the other, Levi Morrison, who is responsible for one of PHP 7’s greatest features yet: return type hints.

            Two awesome guests join this week, from two different framework projects, both who have been very vocal about their interest in PSR-7: HTTP Message. These two chaps were Hari K T and Matthew Weier O’Phinney.

            The grass is always greener on the other side, but we have a little talk with Gary Hockin and regular guest Jacques Woodcock about the pros and cons of going up and down the chain of command in the developer world. After all, it doesn’t just need to be a one-way street.﻿
