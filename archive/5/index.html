            This episode is a long one, but we are back to improved audio and the video is not just one dude eating pzza for an hour. Josh Lockhart of PHP The Right Way and Slim fame, and Jeremy Mikola who is well known for banging on about clouds and playing magic the gathering. Oh, he also works for MongoDB.

            The Front Range PHP user-group joins the show as a live audience for the episode 26, in a new crazy bonus format which Phil thought might be fun. The idea of the episode is for people to generally pick our brain about PHP and code and tech and things. It kinda worked but the sound quality was terrible. Sorry about that folks.

            Talking about feminism in tech is always difficult. This episode was quite a heated discussion with Kayla Daniels and Jessica D’Amico discussing their opinions about women-orientated groups such as PHPWomen and Girls Who Code.

talk about… well, all of that. Two Brazilian PHP developers now living in Amsterdam, tell their stories and talk
about what they do.

            Well known PHP/Laravel nice-guy Jeffrey Way from NetTuts and Laracasts joins regular guest Zack Kitzmiller to
discuss the wonderful world of Laravel once again. This time the discussion focuses on some of the silly complaints
people have with an otherwise wonderful system, and on the reusability of its packages.

            Joe Watkins and Sara Goleman join Phil to make one hell of an episode. These two are not only core contributors to PHP, but are behind a lot of RFCs and decisions that make PHP considerably better. We talk about a whole bunch of awesome stuff, including progress of the named parameters RFC - and the chances of it making in, the new accepted PHP 5.6 feature PHPDBG and what it means for you, HHVM and its relationship to “The PHP”, wether PHP should have a spec for implementations of the language, and a whole bunch of other stuff.
