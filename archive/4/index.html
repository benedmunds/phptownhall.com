            Well known PHP/Laravel nice-guy Jeffrey Way from NetTuts and Laracasts joins regular guest Zack Kitzmiller to
discuss the wonderful world of Laravel once again. This time the discussion focuses on some of the silly complaints
people have with an otherwise wonderful system, and on the reusability of its packages.

            Joe Watkins and Sara Goleman join Phil to make one hell of an episode. These two are not only core contributors to PHP, but are behind a lot of RFCs and decisions that make PHP considerably better. We talk about a whole bunch of awesome stuff, including progress of the named parameters RFC - and the chances of it making in, the new accepted PHP 5.6 feature PHPDBG and what it means for you, HHVM and its relationship to “The PHP”, wether PHP should have a spec for implementations of the language, and a whole bunch of other stuff.

            This episode Ben and Phil are joined by Lee Tengum, who has sold more apps
than Phil and Ben have even thought of. He founded Pancake Payments which has
been featured in Inc. Magazine and is doing very well in the very crowded sector of invoice, time-tracking
and basic project management. Lee also works as a freelance developer for local companies in the “city”
of Cranbrook, BC, Canadia.

            Some episodes of this show are brought to you after more beers than others. This is one of those episodes where its more, so if you don’t like swearing and listening to a slightly confused Bristolian ramble about points he occasionally forgets then you might want to skip this one.
